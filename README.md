As part of the "Full Stack Development Laboratory" course, we developed a dynamic and user-friendly web application titled "EduHub: Educational Resources and Course Marketplace" using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to bridge the gap between learners and quality educational content by offering a dual-platform experience: free tutorial resources and premium course offerings. The "Resources" section provides users with instant access to comprehensive video tutorials on foundational topics such as Cybersecurity, Full Stack Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analytics, and Cloud Computing. Each topic is presented with intuitive icons, concise descriptions, and direct access buttons, ensuring a seamless learning experience. Complementing this is the "Marketplace" section, which showcases advanced, paid courses designed to deepen expertise in specialized domains. Users can browse course details, view pricing, and proceed to checkout through a streamlined interface that includes cart functionality and secure form inputs. The website emphasizes responsive design, clean layout aesthetics, and interactive elements to enhance user engagement. This project not only demonstrates our proficiency in front-end development but also reflects our understanding of user-centric design principles and the practical integration of e-commerce features within an educational context.
